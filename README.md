# CSC3833-Data-Visualization-and-Visual-Analytics
## Overview
This project involved using Python to visualise the data from three different datasets.
The first of these datasets was the house price dataset which included categorical data.
The next of these datasets was the broadband dataset which included numerical data.
The final of these datasets was the financial dataset which included time series data.
Plotting each of these datasets provided its own unique challenges.

In order to visualise the data the useful data first needed to be selected from the datasets.
Outliers were then removed from this selected data.
This data could then be plotted using matplotlib and a line of best fit was added to each graph.
This required a significant amount of tweaking for each of the graphs to visualise the data in the best way possible.
## Reflection
This project allowed me to build on my visualisation and data processing skills.
This allowed me to gain experience processing and visualising various data types.
